# MSFT Stock Prediction using Multivariate Regression Models

This project is a simple demonstration of how we can use different regression models to carry out financial analysis using existing datasets. This model is only a demonstration and by no means will be able to provide you with accurate predictions.  

Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit.

```Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)``` is an American multinational technology company with headquarters in Redmond, Washington. It develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.

```Regression``` is a technique used to model and analyze the relationships between variables and often times how they contribute and are related to producing a particular outcome together. ```Multi-variate Linear Regression``` is created for the relationship between multiple independent input variables (feature variables) and an output dependent variable. The features we use to predict stock prices in this project are:
* Volume 
* L_PCT
* PCT_CHANGE 

The different regression models used in this project are:
* Linear
* Ridge
* Lasso 
* Elastic Net 
* LARS
